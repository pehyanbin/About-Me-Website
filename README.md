# About-Me-Website  
This is the first project for my Web Development Assignment course.<br><br>
We are required to create a personal website that introduces ourselves.<br><br>
The website is created using HTML and CSS.<br><br>
The Matrix waterfall effect is the only element created using JavaScript.<br><br>
